# Writing Good Code

## How to abstract your solution?

Many people view technical interviews as just getting to and being able to explain a solution. However, interviewers are judging your ability to write clean, modular, and adaptable code. Additionally, if your code is clean and readable, it'll help you better convey your solution and will be easier to adapt to follow up questions. The best way to do this is abstract repetitive work into function calls. During an interview, you can just write the function signature and not even need to implement it so you can focus on the core of a problem rather than writing out a simple algorithm like binary search.

We'll go over some general practices on how to abstract function calls and then go through some examples of well structured coding problems.
